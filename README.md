## ðŸ¦‡ VampFetch 

### Neofetch like utility built in Python for Linux.

*This project does not aim to be a replacement to any of the already existing utilities as they are faster, better and more accurate. Mine is merely a fun project I did in 4 hours.*

#### Issues
- Wasn't able to fetch GPU details
- Terminal only fetches $TERM env. variable and does not display the name of the application
- Shell only fetches the $SHELL env. variable and displays the path of the shell binary

##### I have no intention of trying to fix the issues that persist since a utility like this is impractical in Python because of the speed limitations of the language.
